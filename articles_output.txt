Solana, Cardano, and XRP quietly pulled in $40M+ last week.

Digital asset investment products saw a $572M rebound last week, driven by Bitcoin, Ether gains, and U.S approval of crypto in 401(k) plans. Altcoins also attracted notable inflows, despite the overall summer trading slowdown.

After a sluggish mid-year performance, the digital asset investment market made a striking comeback last week. It drew in $572 million in new investments, according to CoinSharesdata.

The turnaround came after a pretty turbulent period of outflows, with $1 billion exiting the market earlier in the week. In fact, CoinShares’ Head of Research James Butterfill linked this liquidity exodus to the disappointing U.S payroll figures that stirred economic jitters previously.

However, this momentum shifted dramatically asBitcoin [BTC]andEthereum [ETH]prices climbed, with ETH touching $4,000 for the first time since December 2024.

The real catalyst came mid-week when news broke that U.S regulators would allow digital assets in 401(k) retirement plans, triggering a wave of $1.57 billion in inflows over just a few days.

Interestingly, the rebound came despite a noticeable slowdown in trading activity during the summer. For example – Data from CoinShares showed that crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) volumes fell 23% from the previous month.

Looking at the inflows data, it can be seen that the United States has remained the dominant driver of inflows, securing $608 million. On the contrary, Canada saw more modest gains of $16.5 million.

On the other side of the Atlantic, European markets stayed cautious, with Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland collectively seeing $54.3 million in outflows.

According to Butterfill, the sudden uptick in capital towards the end of the week may have been driven by a significant U.S. policy change – Permitting digital assets in 401(k) retirement plans.

This announcement, made last Thursday, prompted a wave of investor enthusiasm. It resulted in $1.57 billion in inflows during the latter half of the week.

Among the many digital assets, ETH stood out as the outperformer, maintaining the momentum it built in July. Ether-linked ETPs drew the largest inflows across the market, bringing in nearly $270 million. This underscored the crypto’s strong appeal to institutional investors.

Butterfill added,

“This pushed year-to-date inflows to a new record of $8.2 billion, while recent price gains have driven total assets under management to an all-time high of $32.6 billion, up 82% so far this year.”

ProShares ETFs in the United States topped the weekly inflow charts, attracting $35 million, while CoinShares XBT Provider AB saw $16 million exit. In doing so, the latter extended its total withdrawals for the year to $414 million.

Smaller issuers in the “Other” category stood out, bringing in an impressive $151 million.

Altcoins also saw some action though.Solana [SOL]products welcomed $21.8 million,XRPsecured $18.4 million, and NEAR saw $10.1 million in fresh capital.

All in all, these trends collectively point to persistent investor interest in layer-1 ecosystems and cross-border payment plays, despite muted overall trading volumes.

Title: Is Bitcoin a ‘perfect asset’ with a catch? Willy Woo has this to say about the risk…

Institutional Bitcoin holdings have been surging, but could the treasury boom be setting the stage for a bubble?

While Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest, experts like Willy Woo believe that ETF and corporate holdings could leave the asset vulnerable to centralized control.

Following a rocky phase, the crypto market has been regaining some momentum again, with the market’s leading digital assets posting fresh gains. In fact, according toCoinMarketCap,Bitcoin [BTC]climbed by 2.53% in just 24 hours, with the crypto hitting $121,278 on the charts.

Thanks to these developments, conversations around Bitcoin’s potential to surpass traditional benchmarks like the U.S. dollar and gold have resurfaced again.

Veteran analyst Willy Woo described Bitcoin as “the perfect asset” for the next millennium. And yet, he believes a warning is due. According to him, it cannot rival established stores of value without a substantial influx of capital.

Speakingat the Baltic Honeybadger conference in Riga, Latvia, on 10 August, Woo said,

“The thing is, you don’t get to change the world unless this monetary asset — in my opinion, the perfect asset for the next thousand of years — does not get to do its job unless capital flows in and gets big enough to rival the US dollar.”

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have played a role in this inflow trend too. For example – Data fromFarside Investorshighlighted $403.9 million in net inflows on 8 August – A sign of steady institutional interest.

Naturally, Woo tempered his optimism with caution. He pointed to the opaque debt structures of Bitcoin treasury firms, warning that weaker ones could “blow up” in a downturn, triggering steep losses.

Woo added,

“No one’s really publicly looked deeply into the debt structuring, so I absolutely think the weak ones will blow up, and people can lose a lot of money.”

Woo also flagged altcoin treasuries adopting similar strategies, potentially “creating another treasury bubble.” He stressed that a sharp market correction or prolonged bear phase could expose over-leveraged treasuries, pushing coins back into circulation.

His word of caution echoed previousconcernsabout the risks of liquidity concentration and over-reliance on ETFs and corporate treasuries quietly shaping market fragility. The same can be backed on the quantitative front too.

Consider this – According to Fidelity Digital Assets, the number of public companies holding over 1,000 BTC jumped from 24 towards the end of Q1 2025 to 35 so far in Q3. That is the steepest quarterly rise on record.

Source: X

Also, Sentora’s datashowedthat Bitcoin treasury holdings climbed from 1.2 million BTC in 2024 to over 1.86 million BTC this August.

Finally, Woowarned that the rapid pace of Bitcoin treasury adoption could face a harsh reality check. Especially if the market records a sharp correction or enters a prolonged bear phase.

He added,

“What happens to the bear market? Who’s swimming naked and how many coins get slapped back out into the market?”

He believes that the growing reliance on Spot Bitcoin ETFs, pension funds, and corporate treasuries could centralize Bitcoin in institutional hands. This would leave it vulnerable to potential state-level interference. Especially since deep-pocketed investors still prefer these channels over self-custody.

Title: THESE are the 3 reasons why LINK’s price could rally to $30!

Content:
Chainlink’s recent whale and institutional inflows may stem from its Web3 dominance.

Whales added $13M in LINK, institutions ramped up adoption, and technicals broke a key trendline. A push above $24 could open the path to $30.

Chainlink [LINK]gained by over 30% over the past week, with the daily trading volume hitting $1.35 billion. At the time of writing, LINK was trading near $21 following a modest 1% dip from the previous day’s close.

In fact, the altcoin may be setting up for what seems like the perfect scenario for a rally. On-chain and macroeconomics data were all in support of the price breakout too.

Data from Lookonchainrevealedheavy buying activity backed by CEX outflows and fresh spot purchases. In fact, the largest transaction was a withdrawal worth 510,000 LINK or $11.13 million from Binance to Compound over two days.

On top of that, two other whales bought 59,560 LINK and 44,846 LINK, bringing the total inflows to roughly $13 million. This wave of buying came from both new and existing whales.

Source: Lookonchain

Daily Active Addresses also jumped to 9,410 from 5,500 a week ago,accordingto IntoTheBlock. This can also be seen as a sign of growing retail and whale participation.

Having said that, institutions are also moving in now. Chainlink’s collaborations span global giants like Fidelity, Swift, DTCC, Citi, JPMorgan, and BNP Paribas – Positioning it as a core Web3 infrastructure provider.

According to Chainlink’sZach Rynes,Chainlink Reserve was the answer to how users paid in fiat but tied the economics to its token.

As a result, the DEX volumes rose since the conversions were done on decentralized exchanges. Figures for the same were as high as $1.298 billion in the last 24 hours.

Source: Zach Rynes/X

Chainlink is also a major contender for tokenizing Wall Street, as previously advised by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Apart from institutional involvement, where does the price action stand though? Is it on the right track?

As far as the price charts are concerned, LINK broke out after a double bottom retest at $18 – Clearing a descending trendline that began last December.

At press time, the price action appeared to be eyeing the $30-level. However, it must first break and hold above $24.

Source: Posty/X

What about expert projections though?

Well, analysts likePostycalled LINK “undervalued” and set a bold $100 target. In doing so, Posty claimed that its $15 billion market cap could rise to $100 billion eventually.

Apart from stablecoins, onlyBitcoin [BTC],Ethereum [ETH],XRP, andSolana [SOL]have crossed that level so far.

Title: $166M whale bet keeps ADA steady, but Cardano can rally to $1 ONLY IF…

Content:
Are Cardano whales set for a breakout or a dump?

Whales bought 200 million ADA worth $166 million, spot inflows rose, but perpetual activity slowed down. $0.83 remains a make-or-break level for Cardano’s next rally.

At the time of writing,Cardano [ADA]bulls were in focus again after the altcoin gained by 2.82% in the last 24 hours.

Whales and spot investors purchased a notable amount of ADA within this period. However, perpetual trading volumes revealed a misalignment with this buying activity from other cohorts.

That is why it’s worth analyzing how it could play out for ADA in the short term.

Naturally, the biggest market moves came from the altcoin’s whales. These are the addresses holding between 100 million and 1 billion ADA.

According to Santiment, these holdersscoopedup 200 million ADA, worth about $166 million, between 9 and 10 August.

Source: Santiment

On top of that, spot investors joined the accumulation wave. In fact, CoinGlass datarevealedthat $11 million worth of ADA was purchased over the same period through Spot Exchange Netflows.

More recently, spot buyers added another $3.61 million – Reinforcing the bullish sentiment across the market.

Source: Coinglass

There has been some fading interest among perpetual traders though. In the last 24 hours, for instance, the Long-to-Short ratio in the market fell below 1 – A sign that there may be more selling volume than buying volume.

In fact, trading volume slid by 21.49% to $2.14 billion – A $459 million downtick that hinted at fading activity.

Source: CoinGlass

Worth noting, however, that the overall perpetual market remains intact, with the Open Interest Weighted Funding Rate having a significantly positive reading of 0.0108%.

This means that despite short volumes being higher, a majority of derivative contracts remain from long positions, which continue to pay funding fees.

ADA’s potential move to reclaim $1 is dependent on breaching resistance levels marked at three points on the chart – $0.83, $0.88, and $0.93, respectively.

Source: TradingView

While ADA is yet to trade into these levels recently, analysis revealed that the last time it entered the nearest resistance zone of $0.83, it triggered a decline of over 20%.

If momentum proves insufficient at this level, ADA will risk a significant decline. However, a clean break above $0.83 could set the stage for a strong rally.

Title: Nearly every Ethereum holder in green, BUT ETH’s rally may be far from over!

There may be some news ahead for the world’s largest altcoin.

Ethereum’s rally has pushed 97% of holders into profit. And yet, on-chain metrics revealed that the market might not be overheated.

Ethereum [ETH]holders are riding near-record profits right now. And yet, it would seem that there’s no stopping it in the short-term. According to on-chain data, the altcoin’s rally could push even higher, before cooling down eventually.

Short-term traders are cashing out faster than at any point in the past year, but without tipping the market into exhaustion.

With 97% of Ethereum addressescurrently in profit,you’d expect the market to be approaching exhaustion.

Source: Sentora

However, data from Sentora underlined almost universal gains among holders. This, while Glassnode’s MVRV Extreme Values indicatorremainedwell below the overheated red zone that has historically marked cycle tops.

Source: X

Hovering near the 2.0-level, the MVRV still has space before hitting past peaks above 3.0-3.2. These levels were last seen during euphoric phases in 2017, 2021, and late 2023.

Hence, it can be argued that the market may be in an early to mid-stage profit realization cycle, rather than a final blow-off top.

As crypto analyst Ali Martineznoted, the setup might point to more upside potential. Especially if profit-taking by short-term holders is absorbed by sustained demand.

Ethereum’s latest profit wavehas been drivendisproportionately by short-term investors.

In fact, Glassnode data showed that ETH’s 7-day SMA Realized Profits hit $771 million per day in July, surpassing December 2024’s highs. This was the case before it eased slightly to $553 million this month.

Long-term holder profits have been in line with December’s peak too. Here, it’s worth pointing out that the recent acceleration came from addresses holding ETH for less than six months.

Source: Glassnode

What this implied is that fast-moving traders have been capitalizing on price strength more aggressively than in previous cycles.

However, this has been so without triggering the kind of profit saturation that usually precedes major market tops.

The ongoing rotation from long-term stability to short-term cash-outs is a sign that this is a rally fueled by active turnover, rather than exhaustion. This leaves room forfurther price expansionif demand holds.

Title: Ethena crypto price prediction – Can ENA breach $1 without whale support?

Content:
Ethena surged by 30% in 7 days to a 7-month high amid strengthening actual demand.

Ethena climbed by 31% in a week to hit $0.855. It has been fueled by strong network adoption, retail-led buying, and bullish technicals.

Ethena [ENA]surged by 30.98% over the past week, climbing from $0.51 to a 7-month high of $0.855 on the charts. In fact, its strength has spanned the monthly and yearly charts too, with gains of 143% and 152%, respectively.

At press time, ENA was trading at $0.8086, up 9.05% in just 24 hours. It has been backed by rising network activity, positive sentiment, and steady capital inflows.

Naturally, traders are now eyeing the next leg up in this Ethena price cycle.

Santiment’s data showed Ethena logging positive Price DAA Divergence for seven straight days.

Here, it’s worth noting that a sustained positive DAA Divergence is a sign of strengthening fundamental demand. Especially on the back of network usage and engagement growing too.

Source: Santiment

In such cases, the asset is often undervalued relative to network activity. What this usually implies is that there may be more room for upside as the price aligns with demand.

At the time of writing, the on-chain profitability seemed to reinforce this. Especially since the ratio of transactions in profit to loss stood at 4.16, with 75.38 million transactions in profit versus 18.08 million in loss.

Source: Santiment

Surprisingly, despite the price uptick, Ethena whales are yet to show up across the market.

In fact, the Spot Average Order Size data from CryptoQuant hinted at total whale absence in the spot market.

Source: CryptoQuant

According to the aforementioned chart, there have been no Big Whale Orders in the past 30 days. Also, the Futures Average Order Size data appeared to mirror the same lack of large positions.

The same pattern can also be seen in the Futures market, as per the Futures Average Order Size data. In the Futures market too, whales took a step back – A sign of less speculative activity from large entities.

Source: CryptoQuant

When whales take a step back from the Spot and the Futures market, it reflects a cautious approach as they wait for a motivation to do so.

Finally, it’s worth pointing out that retail participants have dominated recent spot activity.

According to Coinalyze, Ethena recorded three days of consecutive Buy-Sell Delta. At press time, ENA saw 84.2 million in Buy Volumes compared to 75 million in Sell Volumes.

Source: Coinalyze

As a result, the spot market saw a positive Buy- Sell Delta of 8.33 million – A slight hike from 8.09 million the previous day.

Usually, a positive Delta alludes to higher buying pressure relative to Selling pressure. This is often a prelude to higher prices on the charts.

Ethena (ENA) recently bounced off its recent low of $0.55 and successfully defended the $0.60-support level. Shortly after, the price bounced strongly, with the Parabolic SAR dipping below price candles.

Often, when prices flip above the SAR, it means buyers are in control and the upward momentum may be strong. Moreover, the Stochastic RSI surged to 85.37 – Further confirming the buyers’ presence.

Source: TradingView

If buyers keep price above $0.70, a push towards $1 may be plausible. However, failure to hold this zone could drag ENA back to $0.55.

XRP is heading north, but how far can it really go?

Whales moved XRP worth $108M to Coinbase as Exchange Reserves rose. Despite falling volumes though, the bullish chart patterns could target the $3.80 price level.

XRP’srally over the past week has been impressive, with the altcoin climbing by 20% on the price charts. However, XRP bulls may be losing steam now, sparking debate over whether a cooldown is next or not.

In fact, fresh on-chain data has raised some very important questions about the rally’s staying power. For example – Whale Alertflaggedtwo large transactions in the last 24 hours alone.

These transactions totalled 33.396 million XRP tokens worth $108 million, all of which was transferred to Coinbase.

Source: X (Formerly Twitter)

That’s not all though as according to CryptoQuant, Exchange Reserves climbed as more XRP hit centralized platforms.

Source: CryptoQuant

Naturally, such inflows often mean that long-term holders are taking profit, bolstering the short-term bearish case for the altcoin.

At the time of writing, XRP wastradingat $3.25, up 2.5% over the last 24 hours. This, despite the trading volume falling by 15% from its previous session. Such a dip in participation could mean that some traders are stepping back as the price nears its all-time high.

Consider this – AMBCrypto’s technical analysis showed XRP breaking above a descending trendline on the daily chart, then clearing a bullish flag on the 4-hour timeframe. At the time of writing, it appearedto be shaping an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern that is yet to be confirmed.

Source: TradingView

Following the latest breakout from the flag and pole pattern, the altcoin may be poised for a 15% price uptick to hit a new high of $3.80.Such a bullish outlook may be further strengthened by the engulfing candleXRPformed over the past week.

Besides the price action, the Bollinger Bands highlighted strong bullish momentum across the board. However, with the price hovering near the upper band, there may be aminor pullback before another leg higher.

Finally, the Relative Strength Index’s (RSI) reading of 59 implied that XRP bulls might still have some room to push.

At the time of writing, the major liquidation levels were $3.134 on the lower side and $3.334 on the upper side.

Source: CoinGlass

Around these zones, traders built $170.01 million in longs versus $24.85 million in shorts. This could be a sign that XRP bulls are dominating positions and might extend their price rally.

With local all-time highs in these nations, Ethereum has nowhere to go but up.

Ethereum set fresh highs in Japan and South Korea, driven by corporate accumulation and rising leverage. ETH has been trading near $4,300 lately, with momentum building towards a global all-time high.

Ethereum [ETH]has found fresh fuel in Asia.

Its price climbed to local all-time highs inJapanandSouth Korea, proving that demand runs deeper than simple currency moves.

Such a rally is also a sign of robust regional demand, rather than just simple currency effects. Especially since both the Yen and the Won have strengthened against the U.S dollar this year.

On 10 August, ETH’s value touched ¥639,455 in Japan and ₩5.97 million in South Korea, surpassing the peaks set in late 2021.

Source: CoinMarketCap

On the other hand, its value in terms of USD seemed to be hovering near $4,257. For context, that is still below the November 2021 global record of $4,891.

Source: CoinMarketCap

Naturally, this can be seen as a sign of strong regional appetite, boosted by a wave of institutional and corporateinterest.

In particular, U.S-listed Bitmine Immersion Technologies [BNMR] amassed more than $2.9 billion in ETH. It is now aiming to corner up to 5% of the total supply through aggressive accumulation.

Data from CoinGlass revealed thatETH Futures Open Intereststood at $51.61 billion on 8 August (last recorded data), near record territory.

The steady uptick in OI since mid-July, alongside a price surge, hinted at a build-up of leveraged positions betting on further upside.

Source: CoinGlass

This kind of positioning often amplifies price moves, particularly when combined with strong spot demand like that seen recently in Japan and South Korea.

On top of that, broader altcoin sentiment has also improved on the back of the SEC’s softened position towardsRipple and XRP.The expected adoption in retirement investment products like the 401(k) has helped too.

On the technical front, ETH appeared to be trading above both its 9-day and 21-day SMAs at press time – Proving the prevailing uptrend.

Moreover, the RSI hovered around 73. While this underlined the existence of strong momentum on the charts, it also hinted that the altcoin might soon tread the overbought zone.

Source: TradingView

While ETH remains roughly 12% below its global all-time high of $4,891 set in November 2021, the current momentum could cause a breakout soon.

If the bullish structure holds and price consolidates above $4,200, the next test will likely be the $4,500-resistance level before a potential run at new highs.

Institutions are loading up on ETH. However, a hidden risk could flip this rally on its head!

Ethereum’s rally towards $4,800 is being fueled by institutional accumulation, but elevated leverage ratios might hint at potential volatility ahead.

Ethereum [ETH]has traded within a multi-month ascending channel on the charts since bottoming near $1,300 four months ago.

In the intervening period, the altcoin climbed to $4,300, with ETH now edging closer to its $4,800 ATH from four years ago. At press time, ETH was trading at $4,275 after weekly gains of 21%.

Sustained institutional demand remains a major driver of Ethereum’s rally.

A consistently positive Coinbase Premium Index, negative for only seven days in the last three months, hinted at strong U.S. buying. The scale of such purchases is a sign that institutions may be involved.

Source: CryptoQuant

Lending weight to this, Lookonchainreportedthat a single unidentified institution purchased 49,533 ETH worth $212 million in just one day. In fact, over the past week, the same buyer accumulated 221,166 ETH valued at $946.6 million.

Historically, such heavy inflows have preceded price expansions as buying pressure builds on the charts.

Now, while Ethereum may be facing significant demand, its markets have been flashing signs of short-term caution.

In fact, according to CryptoQuant’s analystCryptoOnchain, the all-exchange Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) had a reading of 0.68 – Close to its historic highs.

For context, when the ELR is as high as 0.68, it means that on average, Open Interest in perpetual and futures contracts is 68% of the spot reserves.

Source: CryptoQuant

Binance’s ELR seemed to be lower at 0.52 – A sign that other exchanges carried greater leverage.

Here, it’s worth noting that while 0.68 does not mean maximum leverage, it is high enough to accelerate moves in either direction.

According to AMBCrypto’s analysis, Ethereum saw strong demand across all market participants. Especially institutions.

Accordingly, the altcoin’s Taker Buyer Sell Ratio surged to 1.005 – Hitting the positive zone after previously dipping into negative territory.

Source: CryptoQuant

This ratio, which compares aggressive buying to selling, indicated that buyers, especially institutions, currently have control of the market.

If accumulation continues, ETH could target $4,501 and then $4,788. Conversely, a leverage-driven long squeeze could push the price below $3,980 – A key reversal zone identified by AMBCrypto’s analysis.

Title: Crypto Fear & Greed Index hits 70 as Bitcoin nears its ATH again – What next?

Greed is at a high, but one technical signal could be worth looking into!

The crypto market remains in a strong “greed” phase, with bullish sentiments pushing Bitcoin and Ethereum higher despite overbought signals.

Investor sentiment in the crypto market took a bullish turn recently. This, after the Crypto Fear & Greed Index peaked at 70 – A clear signal of heightened optimism.

At the time of writing, it hadeasedto 62. However, it’s worth pointing out that the index remains firmly in the “Greed” zone. What this implies is that there is a state of sustained market confidence right now.

The improvement in investor sentiment seemed to align with a 2.38%uptickin the global crypto market cap to $4.05 trillion. It was supported byBitcoin [BTC]surgingby 3.33% to $121,706 andEthereum [ETH]climbing by 2.02% to $4,271 over the past 24 hours.

In the past, periods of intense greed in the cryptocurrency market have frequently been followed by price pullbacks or sideways trading. This, as investors secured profits or repositioned to avoid the risks of inflated valuations.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index hinted at robust market confidence at press time. At the same time though, its readings can also be seen as a warning sign. Could there be potential turbulence in the near term?For active traders, this dilemma underlines the importance of assessing risk tolerance and avoiding impulsive moves driven by FOMO.

Santiment’s latest datasets seemed to add another layer to this analysis. For instance – Both Ethereum and Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) appeared to be on the way down after peaking in the overbought zone.

Such a combination could hint at the possibility of a near-term market pullback. However, certainty will remain elusive in such dynamic conditions.

Source: Santiment

Bitcoin’s market dominance continues to play a pivotal role in maintaining the overall bullish sentiment across the crypto sector though.

With a value of 60.80% at press time, this level alluded to a “flight to safety,” with investors increasingly leaning towards the most established and liquid cryptocurrency.Such dominance often sets the tone for the broader market, particularly during periods of rapid price swings or heightened uncertainty.

If this dominance persists, it could help prolong the current wave of greed, keeping bullish momentum intact for now.

Remarking on the same, an X usersaid,

“And they said crypto was dead. This is just the beginning fam – if we map the growth trajectory to traditional markets, we’re looking at serious upside potential. Remember when $1T seemed impossible? Now we’re at $4T and the fear/greed index is only at 62.”

Another X user, Sebastian Diaconu, went a step further andtalkedabout both the good and bad sides of the market, wherein, for the good side, he said,

“Fear-Greed meter is still at decent levels, which means there is a lot of upside potential.”

For the bad side though, he added,

“Altcoin season that everyone is waiting for is not happening. At least not now.  Yes, we have Ethereum, XRP and…that’s about it. So, the major question is: will there be an Altcoin Season or not?”

Is that the whole story though? Well, according to AMBCrypto, a high greed signal doesn’t always translate into an instant downturn.Market sentiment can remain elevated for extended periods, before any significant correction sets in.

For example – On 23 May, the Crypto Fear and Greed Indextouched78, a level firmly in the “extreme greed” zone. This coincided with Bitcoin’s ascent to $111.8k.

Such an alignment is also evidence of how bullish momentum can persist, despite overheated sentiment. This could leave room for further gains before market forces potentially recalibrate.

With key U.S. inflation and spending data on deck, all eyes are on Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has been consolidating ahead of the release of major U.S economic data, with CPI, PPI, and retail sales likely to influence Fed policy. Rising leverage could allude to bullish momentum, but it might also raise the risk of sharp pullbacks if macro data disappoints.

Bitcoin [BTC]has been in a holding pattern lately, with traders bracing for a wave of U.S. economic data this week. Inflation figures, in particular, could set the tone for the Federal Reserve’s next rate move and it could decide whether there will be a new Bitcoin ATH or not.

From 11-15 August, markets will digesta string of high-impact U.S. economic releases.

July’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) lands on Tuesday, 12 August, with core inflation expected to edge up to 2.8% from 2.7%.

Thursday will bring the Producer Price Index (PPI), which will offer a closer look at input costs that could filter through to retail prices.

Finally, Friday’s retail sales data, alongside fresh readings on consumer sentiment and inflation expectations, will round out the picture of economic health in the United States.

Source: cmegroup.com

In fact, at the time of writing, the CME FedWatch Tool highlighted an 88% probability of a September rate cut.

Whether this week’s data shifts the Fed’s position could determine if Bitcoin is primed for a new ATH in the short-term.

This week, Bitcoin’s Aggregated Funding Rates moved into clearly positive territory (about 0.012 on the chart). This, while the Open interest reversed its early-August decline and climbed to roughly $41.5 billion.

These two readings implied that fresh, leveraged longs may be behind the move – A clean bullish fuel that would explain the sharp price advance.

And yet, sustained positive funding might raise the cost of carrying long positions and can make gains fragile. A macro miss or a volatility spike could trigger rapid de-leveraging.

Here, it’s worth noting that Ethereum’s ratio against Bitcoin slipped from its recent peak near 0.037 – A sign of capital rotation towards BTC.

In fact, BTC/USD’s daily chart suggested that momentum was strong at press time.

The MACD formed a bullish crossover, while the RSI’s reading of nearly 66 meant that there may be some room before hitting the overbought territory. For its part, Bitcoin’s price cleared $120,000 with conviction, making the $118,000-$119,000 zone a key support if a pullback happens.

Source: TradingView

The next key test? The $123kBitcoin ATH. A decisive breakout and sustained hold above it could trigger price discovery.

With ETH/BTC retreating, Bitcoin’s dominance may strengthen further. However, sustaining this run will hinge on macro data aligning with bullish expectations.

Title: MiCA and gaming: What Europe’s landmark crypto regulation means for blockchain casinos
Link: https://ambcrypto.com/mica-and-gaming-what-europes-landmark-crypto-regulation-means-for-blockchain-casinos/
Content:
Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) is a regulation that comes at a critical time in an era when barriers between gaming, finance, and digital ownership are becoming increasingly blurred. With blockchain-based casinos and GameFi platforms gaining popularity across the continent, MiCA is poised to set a global standard for digital asset economy regulation. In the blockchain gaming industry, particularly crypto casinos, this blanket legislation represents another level of compliance, transparency, and opportunity.

Although MiCA was initially written to establish a set of similarities in the treatment of digital assets within the European Union, its effects will be much broader than those affecting stablecoins and centralized exchanges. Blockchain casinos, which typically operate on the edge of regulatory transparency, will henceforth need to align with the standards that large crypto institutions are required to follow. The outcome may transform not only the functioning of these platforms, but also the way the players are involved in them throughout the EU.

In 2023, MiCA was adopted and will be implemented in phases over 2024 and 2025. It primarily focuses on regulating crypto-assets that do not fall within the scope of current financial laws, such as utility tokens, asset-referenced tokens (including stablecoins), and service providers. It regulates the crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) licensing, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and sets high standards of consumer protection.

In the case of the blockchain gaming industry, this brings a formal regulation framework where there was very little or none at all. Wagering platforms that use tokens, as well as those accepting crypto deposits or in-game token economies, are now subject to MiCA when directed to users in the EU. Those are blockchain casinos on Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, and newer L2s, regardless of the proprietary tokens or stablecoins they use.

Smart contracts are used in blockchain casinos, allowing the automation of payouts, transparent odds, and decentralized in-game asset ownership. This provides a sense of fairness and autonomy to the players, but it also raises regulatory issues related to user protection, fraud prevention, and financial monitoring for regulators.

MiCA starts filling this gap. The casinos accepting or issuing the tokens that are regarded as crypto-assets under the regulation will be obliged to either become CASPs or collaborate with the licensed intermediaries. This incorporates capital reserve requirements, reporting risks related to tokens, and implementing rigorous identity verification procedures.

This change marks the passing of the free-market casino-on-the-blockchain days in the EU. The operators must be serious about compliance, just as they are with conventional online casinos. This involves the use of AML procedures, transaction tracking, and possibly geo-fencing of users in non-compliant jurisdictions. Although this might appear to be a burden, it also paves the way to increased legitimacy and access to mainstream players who have been cautious of unregulated crypto platforms.

The attractiveness of blockchain casinos may stem from the concept of anonymous gambling, rapid withdrawals, and provably fair gaming. Nevertheless, the absence of regulation has led to the emergence of scammers, rug pulls, and unreliable operators, which destabilize user confidence. MiCA alters this situation by compelling crypto casinos to be transparent and accountable.

The bar has been raised in terms of token transparency, with whitepapers providing clear descriptions of how tokens will function, the risks they entail, and their economic models. Betting in stablecoins will need to satisfy reserve requirements and can be audited to ensure solvency. With MiCA, the era of lowly announced tokenomics and questionable liquidity guarantees is probably coming to an end.

The law also assists in getting rid of bad actors, as they will be forced out of regulated areas, and fly-by-night platforms will have a difficult time flourishing. As a player, this makes the environment a safer one with tokens and games having a higher chance of doing what is promised in the advertisement, and money being safer.

To the rest of the world outside Europe, jurisdictions such as Canada are beginning to take notice of these developments. Although MiCA does not technically have anything to do with Canadian players, it creates an atmosphere that shapes the actions of the world. Most of the platforms reviewed on thebest casino sites for Canadiansare currently making adjustments to their terms and backend systems in preparation for similar legislation in other jurisdictions.

The ripple effect of MiCA extends beyond the EU. Since a significant number of blockchain projects are targeting a global audience, developers now need to consider how their tokens and game mechanics will align with European regulations, even when they have offices in different jurisdictions. This is particularly true for projects targeting a multi-regional audience with EU players.

Other nations will likely follow MiCA and implement the most successful policies when it becomes the first significant crypto framework to be widely adopted. That is the position of MiCA regarding whitepaper disclosures, stablecoin reserves, and consumer protection, all of which directly apply to blockchain casinos. This would establish a de facto standard that may make international compliance with gaming platforms easier, thereby diminishing the complexity of inconsistent national regulations.

It also allows more cross-jurisdiction cooperation. An example is a Malta or Estonia-licensed casino, which is an EU member country and is now able to conduct business throughout the EU without having to navigate various regulatory environments. This creates new market opportunities for blockchain gaming startups that are compliant with MiCA requirements at the initial stage.

The first step towards succeeding in the EU as a blockchain casino is to thoroughly audit its token structure, payout system, and marketing strategy. MiCA-compliant wallet providers and payment processors will become important partners. Such investments will include legal advice, AML software, and crypto environments.

Early adopters of the platform can gain a competitive edge. With traditional gambling companies considering the adoption of blockchain, the fact that crypto-native casinos are licensed and compliant with MiCA may make them appealing acquisition targets or strategic partners.

MiCA does not pose a threat to innovation in blockchain gaming; instead, it is a call to maturity. The decentralized platforms, characterized by transparency and security, will now require sound regulatory practices. That convergence may be the factor that introduces blockchain casinos to the mainstream, making their position in the new digital entertainment world legitimate.

MiCA regulation in Europe is not merely a system of compliance for cryptocurrencies; it is also a paradigm shift that will transform the functioning and interaction of blockchain-based casinos with their players. It creates new challenges for operators, but at the same time, it guarantees long-term benefits in terms of user trust, legal clarity, and market expansion.

Title: Ethereum’s $4,300 push meets falling Bitcoin dominance – Is a flippening next?

Bitcoin’s dominance fell to 60.69%, mirroring patterns that previously preceded Ethereum’s ascent.

Ethereum’s surge past $4,300 and declining Bitcoin dominance could signal a potential “flippening,” with experts predicting shifting momentum between Bitcoin and altcoins over the coming months.

Ethereum [ETH]surged past $4,300 whileBitcoin’s [BTC]dominance declined, fueling speculation that Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin in value within the next year.

In fact, with strong technical indicators and growing institutional interest backing this momentum, experts are now increasingly discussing the possibility of a “flippening.” This is the term for if and when Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin as the world’s leading cryptocurrency.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s market dominancestoodat 60.74%. However, analysts like Lark Davisbelievethat previous drops of this magnitude have usually preceded Ethereum hitting new all-time highs.

That’s not all though as Glassnode data shared by analyst Ali Martinez revealed Ethereum’s Net Capital Change outpacing Bitcoin’s. This has prompted some market watchers to call this a clear sign of altcoin season.

At press time, ETH wastradingat $4,298 on the price charts, with the altcoin up 1.72% in the last 24 hours.

This seemed to coincide with its OTC desk activity signaling strong whale interest in the altcoin’s market.

Crypto’s R Usreportedthat Binance, Coinbase, and Bitstamp moved about $160 million in ETH to Galaxy Digital in one hour. The largest transaction was worth 4,500 ETH ($18.99 million). On top of that, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s holdingsexceeded$1 billion amid reports of scarce ETH supply on OTC desks.

The level of scarcity showcased liquidity challenges for large buyers.

Here, it’s worth pointing out that various institutions are also backing Ethereum. Milk Road pointed out the same on X, claiming,

At the time of writing, the CMC Altcoin Season Indexhad a readingof 38/100 – A sign that the market was still Bitcoin-leaning, despite ETH’s recent gains.

Its findings were backed by Joao Wedson, Founder & CEO of Alphractal. Henoted,

“The real Altcoin Season hasn’t even started yet. Smart money flows from BTC to ETH, then to Top Caps, and finally to Mid & Low Caps. Altcoin fun is just getting started — and it could last until November.”

There may still be some cause for optimism though. Amidst this market uncertainty,Ted Pillows, a partner at OKX, projected a rotation pattern, one where ETH breaks its ATH and triggers a mini alt season. He added,

“Then, capital rotates into BTC, aiming for $140K.”

Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, Deputy CEO of Bitpanda,supportedthis view. He claimed that last week’s altcoin surge showed investors are increasingly willing to venture beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum into riskier assets.

Title: Is Bitcoin too centralized now to succeed? Binance’s grip raises new red flags!

Content:
With over 20% of BTC reserves on Binance, market influence grows. So do the risks though.

Binance’s steady 20%+ share of Bitcoin reserves is keeping it a dominant force in price discovery, increasing market fragility. Analysts warn that growing reliance on ETFs and treasuries introduces hidden structural risks.

Binance may hold the lion’s share ofBitcoin [BTC]reserves, but does that kind of concentration come at a cost?

With so much liquidity in one place, the exchange’s influence over price discovery grows. This leaves the market more exposed to sudden shocks. On-chain analyst Willy Woo believes that the surge in Bitcoin treasury holdings and heavy reliance on ETFs could be building quiet, structural risks that most investors aren’t yet factoring in.

So, what now?

Binancehas held a steady gripon Bitcoin reserves this summer, with its share hovering around 20-21% since early June. Short-lived spikes to 22-23% in late July and early August likely came from tactical flows (either net deposits or outflows from rival exchanges), before quickly reverting to baseline.

Source: Cryptoquant

This stability has revealed no structural shift in exchange dominance yet.

And yet, a 20%+ share keeps Binance as the key venue for price discovery, where liquidity concentration amplifies its sway over funding rates, order book deltas, and liquidation cascades.

Here, the reserve ratio is a critical market signal.

When Binance’s reserves rise alongside Bitcoin’s price, it often points to supply replenishment on the exchange. This softens bullish momentum, unless spot demand stays strong. On the contrary, falling reserves during a price rally are usually a sign of a healthier, demand-led uptrend as supply tightens.

Given Binance’s outsized role in derivatives trading, even small shifts in reserves can influence funding rates and position liquidations.

Building on this assumption, on-chain analyst Willy Woo issued a critical warning recently. He claimed that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory depends on significantly larger capital inflows to sustain its growth and global relevance. He also noted that Bitcoin’s $2.42 trillion market cap is still far behind gold and the greenback.

At theBaltic Honeybadger conferencein Riga, Latvia, he said,

“You don’t get to change the world unless this monetary asset – in my opinion, the perfect asset for the next thousand years – does not get to do its job unless capital flows in and gets big enough to rival the US dollar…”

Whiletreasury adoption and ETFsare fueling growth, Woo cautioned that hidden debt risks, reliance on custodians, and the threat of “being rugged at a nation-state level” could trigger systemic shocks. Especially if a market downturn forces coins back into circulation.

Title: XRP Futures outpace Solana – Will $3.28 billion unlock stop the $3.50 charge?

Futures data has been backing XRP bulls, but an escrow could pose some danger.

XRP saw Futures volume and Open Interest spike, boosting the market’s bullish sentiment. And yet, a multi-billion-dollar escrow unlock to unknown wallets could inject selling pressure, leaving traders cautious about a sustained upside on the charts.

On 10 August,XRPclosed at a value of $3.1879 on the charts, down 3.8% in just 24 hours. This pullback followed a brief rally after news broke out that theSEC was dropping its case against Ripple Labs.

And yet, institutional activity has remained high, with Remittix’s $18.5 million bounty aimed at overhauling its payment systems.

Thanks to the same, at the time of writing, XRP’s price seemed to be flashing both bullish and bearish signals – A sign of traders being cautious.

XRP’s 24-hour Futures volume surged by 207.74% to $12.4 billion, outpacing Solana’s $9.6 billion.

Open Interest climbed by 15.02% to $5.9 billion, aboveDogecoin [DOGE],Ethereum [ETH],Solana [SOL], andToncoin [TON]– All of which held over $1 billion, but trailed XRP’s growth.

Source: Cas Abbe/X

Funding Rates turned positive too, signaling that buyers may be paying shorts to keep positions open.

Owing to this momentum,XRPemerged as the third-highest in the list of cryptos with the highest 24-hour liquidations, excluding stablecoins.

As expected, these bullish signals put about $150 million worth of high leveraged shorts at the risk of liquidation. And, these orders were placed between the $3.27 and $3.37 levels.

In the event that the price respects bulls’ control, a run on these shorts could result in a short squeeze. This could see the price of XRP breach the $3.50-level on the charts.

Fewer positions were clustered below press time levels – A sign that traders favored upside bets. However, their scale appeared to be far smaller than the sell-side orders overhead.

On 9 August, more than $3.28 billion in XRP was unlocked from escrow. This unlock was split into transaction batches of $1.64 billion, $328 million, and $1.32 billion, as perWhale Alert.

The release to unknown wallets risks adding selling pressure by expanding the circulating supply.

Historically, such events have weighed on XRP’s price, especially when demand fails to match the inflows.

At press time, while bullish metrics seemed to outweigh bearish cues, the scale of the escrow unlock injected some uncertainty in the market.

Hence, traders may prefer waiting for a clearer breakout or breakdown before committing to large positions.

Title: Decoding Tron’s $0.30 breakout – Is a 32% TRX rally ahead?
Link: https://ambcrypto.com/tron-breaks-0-30-assessing-how-trx-can-push-past-0-45/
Content:
Tron’s breakout and strong Mayer Multiple hint at sustained gains if momentum holds steady.

Tron’s breakout above $0.30 is backed by strong technicals and rising social attention.Slight short bias in derivatives could spark a squeeze if bullish momentum continues.

Tron [TRX]has maintained a steady upward trajectory in recent weeks, reflecting both technical strength and growing investor confidence.

At press time,TRX traded at $0.3401, further cementing its position above key support. This level signals a healthy trend that is far from overbought conditions, often marked by multiples above 2.0.

Also, theMayer Multiplesat at 1.28, indicating TRX’s price is 28% above its 250-day Moving Average.

Therefore, Tron’s rally appears to be built on sustainable fundamentals rather than speculative hype, leaving room for measured growth ahead.

After consolidating in a multi-month accumulation zone between $0.20 and $0.30, TRX broke out with conviction, clearing resistance at $0.30.

This breakout has opened the door for a potential 32% rally toward $0.45, with momentum supported by a steady rise in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), that sat near 68, as of writing.

Such levels suggest strong buying interest without tipping into extreme overbought conditions.

Therefore, this pattern signals that buyers remain in control, with the breakout potentially acting as a launchpad for further gains if bullish momentum persists.

Source: TradingView

According to Santiment analytics, Funding Rates for TRX have remained slightly positive at 0.01% in recent sessions, reflecting a balanced yet bullish bias among leveraged traders.

This stability contrasts with the extreme spikes often seen during overheated rallies, suggesting that sentiment is optimistic without excessive risk-taking.

Moreover, steady funding rates imply that both longs and shorts are engaged in a relatively even battle for market direction.

Consequently, this cautious leverage environment may help sustain Tron’s current rally without triggering rapid corrections caused by overextended positions.

Source: Santiment

At press time, Social Dominance for TRX has surged to 1.10%, highlighting a noticeable increase in online discussions and market visibility.

This rise often signals that the asset is gaining attention from a broader pool of retail participants, which can boost liquidity and short-term momentum.

However, social hype alone is not enough to drive prices sustainably; it must align with strong on-chain and technical metrics.

In Tron’s case, this growing attention coincides with healthy technical conditions, potentially reinforcing the bullish narrative if positive sentiment remains intact.

Source: Santiment

At the time of writing, the Long/Short ratio sat at 0.90, with shorts making up 52.47% of positions compared to 47.53% longs.

This slight short bias could either reflect skepticism toward Tron’s breakout or a tactical positioning by traders seeking to hedge.

However, if TRX maintains upward momentum, this imbalance could trigger short covering, adding fuel to the rally.

Therefore, monitoring shifts in this ratio will be key to anticipating possible volatility spikes or continuation patterns in the near term.

Source: CoinGlass

Tron’s breakout, supported by a strong Mayer Multiple, balanced Funding Rates, and rising social interest, reflects a rally built on steady momentum rather than hype.

Shorts currently outpace longs, but sustained upward pressure could trigger covering, adding fuel to gains.

If technical and sentiment indicators remain aligned, TRX could extend its advance toward higher targets while maintaining market stability.
